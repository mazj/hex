HEX Programming Language
========================

HEX is a multi-paradigm programming language that supports both static and dynamic types, and was designed with the core principles of simplicity, readability, versatility and scalability to allow developers to create a diversity of types of computer programs with modern language features, succinct syntax and semantics that are built into the core of the language construct.

HEX syntax and semantics resembles a lot of the modern programming languages that you've probably heard or even used. For example, HEX has a indented syntax very much like Python. It supports objected-oriented programming with class and struct definitions very much like C++ and Java. It utilizes basic control statements such as if, for, and while just like pretty much every other languages out there. However, HEX does have its own syntax and semantics for aspects of the language that might not seen familiar to you.
